## About
This is a **Hello React!** web app template written in Python-Flask for the back end and React-JS for the front end. You can use this starter files as a template for your own web app projects.

## How I Did It!
You can find a walkthrough of how I build this application from scratch on [my blog](https://medium.com/@tonyparkerkenz/a-template-for-creating-a-full-stack-web-application-with-flask-npm-webpack-and-reactjs-be2294b111bd)

## Instructions
Below are the installing and running procedues
### Installing
1. make sure you have python, npm, and pip installed on your machine.
For this project, I used : **npm v4.6.1**, **pip v18.0**, **python v3.6.2**
2. Enter in to the directary *hello_template/templates/static/* and run the command `npm install`. This will download and install all the dependencies listed in *package.json*.
3. In the static directory, start the npm watcher to build the front end code with the command `npm run watch`
4. Create a python virtualenv(Optional)
5. Install flask with the command `$ pip install flask`
6. Install Reactjs with the command `$ npm i react react-dom --save-dev`
### Running
1. Go to the root directory and start the server with `python run.py`
2. If all is working correctly, you will be given an address http://127.0.0.1:5000/ which you can open in your favorite browser and see our application running and displaying “Hello React!”
